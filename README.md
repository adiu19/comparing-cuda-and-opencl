You are currently at the project root directory, which contains a makefile and 5 different folders (each corresponding to an application). Each application in turn has 3 implementations - cuda, opencl, serial 

1. You can simply run the command "make" from here to build all the 5 * 3 = 15 implementations.
2. "make clean" will remove all previously created executable and clean up all directories

Each application folder in turn has its own README file. That will guide you how to run it, since some applications require input data to be read from file. We have provided a few input files in the application directories itself.
